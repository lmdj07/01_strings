# IDEAS TO ENHANCE GAME
######################################################################################################
# If user does not want to spend all they can give to charity from list of preferred chrities - DONE
# need to display a list of charities - DONE
# If user goes over a million they need to sell back at a 5% LOSS
# if user chooses to start all over again, they get 10% less money (maybe 10% of their ending balance 
# deducted from  the million)
# if the user choses to abort the game altogether, they must leave a comment; comments need to be saved to a log file
# save comments in an array???
# if user wants something not in the list, they can say what that is and fetch the price from ???? web?
